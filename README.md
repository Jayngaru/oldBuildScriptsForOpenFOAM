oldBuildScriptsForOpenFOAM
==========================

Repository where I keep some of my old build scripts for old versions of OpenFOAM.

License-wise, all provided under GPL v3, as further described in the file `LICENSE`.

This [git repository](https://github.com/wyldckat/oldBuildScriptsForOpenFOAM) was brought to you by Bruno Santos (wyldckat@github working at [blueCAPE Lda](www.bluecape.com.pt)).


Description
===========

  * The following scripts are from this blog page of mine: http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/blogs/wyldckat/649-blast-past-installing-openfoam-1-5-modern-linux-boxes.html
    * `of15w17.sh`
    * `of15w17_v2.sh`
    * `of15w17_v3.sh`

  * The script `of15-dev_w17.sh` was derived from the previous scripts and was meant for building the variant OpenFOAM 1.5-dev on Ubuntu. Problem is that it never ended up in a good result so I ended up giving up on it. It's provided here, since it might come in handy for somebody.
